			<h1>Pixyt is now closed.</h1>
			<p>Thank you for visiting. It has been a wonderful journey, and we have met many great photographers and learned a lot in the process. Pixyt is no longer operating however.</p>
			<p>The founder - <a href="http://samueldelesque.me">Samuel Delesque</a> - is now living and working in New York. Feel free to shoot him a note if you would like to build a custom photography website.</p>
